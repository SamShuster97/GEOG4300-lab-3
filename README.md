Question 2 (out of 2): 1.5 See above<p>
Question 3 (out of 5): 4. You're grouping by restaurant name here, which also wasn't in the question and keeps those word counts very low.<p>
Question 4 (out of 2): 2<p>
Question 5 (out of 3): 2. Similar grouping problems here--needed to NOT group by word, as you'll only get a count for each word rather than by sentiment.<p>
Question 6 (out of 3): 2. It looks like this is for all restaurants, not burger places.<p>
Question 7 (out of 2): 2. <p>
<p>
Total (out of 20): 15.5. You had some problems with grouping here in this analysis--let me know if you want to talk through what didn't work well.
